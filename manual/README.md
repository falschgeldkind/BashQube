DIRECTORY FOR MANUAL CONFIGURATION SCRIPTS
Put scripts that require active oversight or manual interaction (e.g. non silent, interactive installations) in the 'manual' directory
The files have to be named like this: dd_scriptname.sh (dd stands for two digits like '00').

(In the UI they will be represented by the number '1dd')
