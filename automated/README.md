DIRECTORY FOR FULLY AUTOMATED CONFIGURATION SCRIPTS
Put scripts that are fully automated and do not require any interaction in the 'automated' directory. 
The files have to be named like this: dd_scriptname.sh (dd stands for two digits like '00').
Tasks beginning with '0' are considered basic configuration steps. Which means they are executed before BashQube asks for manual configuration steps
